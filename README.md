# MSA-Device-Adaptors

The MSActivator(TM) is a multi-tenant, full lifecycle management framework developed for agile service
design and assurance, making automation not only possible - but easy.


### Device Adaptors

The MSActivator comes with several pre-built device adaptors providing all the necessary functionality lifecycle management from provisioning to image and asset management. Adaptors provide the necessary interface to communicate with different devices. 

Details on how to get started with the device adaptor is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/ubiqube/OpenMSA-Device-Adaptors/wiki)

### Manufacturer and Model ID Convention
If you need to create a new manufacturer or new model ID, you must follow the following convention : 

YYMMDDNN :

-YY last 2 digits of the year : e.g. 16 for 2016

-MM months e.g. 05 for May

-DD day of the month

-NN number in case you need to develop more than one adaptor on the same day.
